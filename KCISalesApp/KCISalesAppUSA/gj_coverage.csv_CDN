During a course of treatment, a repeat application of CTPs is not considered medically reasonable and necessary when previous applications were unsuccessful. Unsuccessful treatment is defined in this situation as increase in size or depth of a wound or ulcer, or no change in baseline size or depth and no sign of improvement or indication that improvement is likely (such as granulation or epithelialization and no progress toward closing) since the previous application.3. Retreatment of healed ulcers is not considered medically reasonable and necessary. Retreating the wound with the same CTP product is not indicated for ulcers for which an initial course of treatment with the same CTP was unsuccessful. An unsuccessful course of treatment is defined in this case as incomplete healing following maximal numbers of applications and/or maximal duration of treatment time indicated by the FDA label of the individual product and/or this LCD.4. CTPs are contraindicated in patients with inadequate control of underlying conditions or exacerbating factors, or other contraindication (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, active infection, active Charcot arthropathy of the ulcer extremity, and/or vasculitis)5.

Coverage will not be provided under this LCD for any wound treatment that does not meet the definition of Q4107. All other such products will be considered at most, biologic wound dressings which are included in the Evaluation and Management (E&M) service and should not be billed separately.","  Consistent with FDA product labeling which limits the use of the CTP (Q4107) to clean wounds thus requiring at most minimal debridement, CPT codes 15002 through 15005 are not appropriate. The minimal wound preparation described by these codes is part of the application procedure code, as clearly included in the procedure CPT description. To emphasize this point: The CPT Manual introductory comments to the ""Skin Replacement Surgery"" chapter in the paragraph starting with ""Skin Substitutes grafts"" reconfirms this position, ""Removal of current graft and/or simple cleansing of wound is included, when performed. Do not report 97602. Debridement is considered a separate procedure only when gross contamination requires prolonged cleansing when appreciable amounts of devitalized or contaminated tissue are removed, or when debridement is carried out separately without immediate primary closure."" The medical record documentation must clearly support that any amount of debridement was medically reasonable and necessary. Literature clearly demonstrates that development on as often as a weekly basis of necrosis significant enough to warrant debridement strongly suggests that vascularity is insufficient to allow wound healing, even with the use of skin substitute therapy. CGS considers the CPT debridement code to be appropriate for use only by Physicians or NPPs (with the exception of the Physical Therapy debridement codes). Billing for debridement performed during routine dressing changes in the course of treatments as contemplated in this LCD is not appropriate. Debridement carried out by a Physical Therapist must be done within a Plan of Care authorized and closely supervised by the treating Physician.   Compliance with the provisions in this policy is subject to monitoring by active and ongoing pre and post payment data analysis and subsequent medical review.Note: Medicare may make payment only for those services performed by persons with appropriate education, knowledge, skill and competence. Medicare may make payment for physician services performed by persons licensed by the state to perform them. Because applications of Graftjacket RTM  as well as any subsequently accepted similar product, are physician (surgical) services, Medicare payment for the products and their applications will be made only to licensed physicians and qualified non-physician practitioners who are licensed to perform these physician services (nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and physician assistants)."," Note: Documentation must indicate that these conditions have been successfully treated and resolved prior to CTP treatment.1.

"" Failed response"" is defined as an ulcer that has increased in size or depth, or no change in baseline size or depth and no sign of improvement or indication that improvement is likely (such as granulation, epithelialization, or progress towards closing). Documentation of response requires measurements of the initial ulcer, at the completion of at least four weeks of conservative wound-care measures and immediately prior to placement of the skin substitute.2. Presence of partial and full-thickness ulcers, joint capsule, or exhibiting exposed bone or sinus tracts.3. Wounds are clean and free of infection4.

All other such products will be considered at most, biologic wound dressings which are included in the Evaluation and Management (E&M) service and should not be billed separately.","  Consistent with FDA product labeling which limits the use of the CTP (Q4107) to clean wounds thus requiring at most minimal debridement, CPT codes 15002 through 15005 are not appropriate. The minimal wound preparation described by these codes is part of the application procedure code, as clearly included in the procedure CPT description. To emphasize this point: The CPT Manual introductory comments to the ""Skin Replacement Surgery"" chapter in the paragraph starting with ""Skin Substitutes grafts"" reconfirms this position, ""Removal of current graft and/or simple cleansing of wound is included, when performed. Do not report 97602. Debridement is considered a separate procedure only when gross contamination requires prolonged cleansing when appreciable amounts of devitalized or contaminated tissue are removed, or when debridement is carried out separately without immediate primary closure."" The medical record documentation must clearly support that any amount of debridement was medically reasonable and necessary. Literature clearly demonstrates that development on as often as a weekly basis of necrosis significant enough to warrant debridement strongly suggests that vascularity is insufficient to allow wound healing, even with the use of skin substitute therapy. CGS considers the CPT debridement code to be appropriate for use only by Physicians or NPPs (with the exception of the Physical Therapy debridement codes). Billing for debridement performed during routine dressing changes in the course of treatments as contemplated in this LCD is not appropriate. Debridement carried out by a Physical Therapist must be done within a Plan of Care authorized and closely supervised by the treating Physician.   Compliance with the provisions in this policy is subject to monitoring by active and ongoing pre and post payment data analysis and subsequent medical review.Note: Medicare may make payment only for those services performed by persons with appropriate education, knowledge, skill and competence. Medicare may make payment for physician services performed by persons licensed by the state to perform them. Because applications of Graftjacket RTM  as well as any subsequently accepted similar product, are physician (surgical) services, Medicare payment for the products and their applications will be made only to licensed physicians and qualified non-physician practitioners who are licensed to perform these physician services (nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and physician assistants)."," Note: Documentation must indicate that these conditions have been successfully treated and resolved prior to CTP treatment.1. Applied to ulcers that have failed to respond to conservative wound-care measures. "" Failed response"" is defined as an ulcer that has increased in size or depth, or no change in baseline size or depth and no sign of improvement or indication that improvement is likely (such as granulation, epithelialization, or progress towards closing). Documentation of response requires measurements of the initial ulcer, at the completion of at least four weeks of conservative wound-care measures and immediately prior to placement of the skin substitute.2. Presence of partial and full-thickness ulcers, joint capsule, or exhibiting exposed bone or sinus tracts.3. Wounds are clean and free of infection4.  Only apply CTPs to wounds with adequate circulation/oxygenation to support tissue growth/wound healing as evidenced by physical examination (presence of acceptable peripheral pulses and/or Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) of no less than 0.65).5. For diabetic foot ulcers the patient's medical record should reflect a diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and reflect medical management for this conditionCTPs must be provided in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved package label","1.
